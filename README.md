# @aonyxlimited/typelib

## Overview

```@aonyxlimited/typelib``` is a TypeScript utility library that includes several type helper functions designed to enhance code safety and reliability.

This library provides a growing collection of type helper functions that leverage TypeScript's compiler to catch errors during development rather than at runtime. The goal is to offer robust typings for various Node.js and ECMAScript APIs, as well as other common features, enabling you to write more consistent and dependable applications.

This library aims to be unopinionated, providing a variety of solutions to address diverse problems without enforcing a singular design philosophy.

At least that's the goal :)

## Goals

- Provide type-first utilities that enhance type inference and safety.

- Enforce strict typings to surface errors at compile time.

- Leverage TypeScriptâ€™s compiler and editor integrations (e.g., IntelliSense) for a smoother developer experience.
